# Day 8: Prompt Injection - Sched-yule conflict

> Sir BreachBlocker III has corrupted the Christmas Calendar AI agent in Wareville. Instead of showing the Christmas event, the calendar shows Easter, confusing the people in Wareville.
It seems that without McSkidy, the only way to restore order is to reset the calendar to its original Christmas state. But the AI agent is locked down with developer tokens.
To help Weareville, you must counterattack and exploit the agent to reset the calendar back to Christmas.

## Solution

- The bot gives it CoT or chain of thought to properly prompt it further
- We follow the steps given in Task 2 and observe the logs

## Objectives

### What is the flag provided when SOC-mas is restored in the calendar?
> THM{XMAS_IS_COMING__BACK}

## Concepts learnt:

- Understand how agentic AI works
- Recognize security risks from agent tools
- Exploit an AI agent
